The expected solution is the "naive" approach which basically consist of decomposing the problem by following the problem instructions. Even though the problem is not complex, we expect the developer to write efficient code and tests (unit tests and property-based tests).

Another approach can be found by analysing deeper the raising patterns of the problem but we do not necessarily expect the candidate to develop it.
